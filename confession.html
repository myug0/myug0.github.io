    <h1>To Aizen Louisse Natividad Cosme</h1>
    <p>Hi ulet, Aizen! To specify, I am writing this for Aizen Louisse Natividad Cosme only! I'm writing another message para sayo to clear things up. I'm not Tristan nor Nat. If you think my previous message was made by ChatGPT, well I'm writing this to prove you wrong. Aizen, I like you for every part of youâ€”your flaws, your talents, just everything about you. I might've said it again but I do mean it. I likeâ€”no, I love you for being you and just the way you are is more than enough. Basta ikaw, sapat na.</p>

    <p>Not to be corny or anything, but no matter how many words I say about loving, caring, and yearning for you, I mean every part of itâ€”with all of my hypothalamus. I deeply admire you for your funny, kind, and caring personality. Your smile immediately makes up and radiates my day up. "You're the sunshine on my lifeee", literally. Because you yourself, is so colorful in my world of monochrome.</p>

    <p>You make everything so tolerable, my Paraluman. I can't stop but smile when I think about you. "We only met each other just the other day but you already got me feeling some type of way", this Chase Atlantic song immediately made me think about you. I know you love Chase Atlantic and Arthur Nery so I learned some of their songs because of you. Because of you, I was inspired to actually learn something new. I love all types of music but rarely listen to Chase Atlanticâ€”but for you, I would.</p>

    <p>I really do mean everything I say. To be completely honest, I'm a yapper. But for you, I would love to listen to you all day. I would love to know about how your day went. I would love to spend time with you like going to churchâ€”reflecting on the Bible together. Anything with you involved, I love.</p>

    <p>Once again, I'll end my message with a poem I made and dedicated to you called <em>"Kay Tagal kitang mamahalin"</em> which I wrote on exactly August 5, 2025â€”one year of loving you. A hint is that I am your friend but definitely not Kristel and the others. Vian and Kristel specifically know that I like youuu hehe. </p>

    <div class="poem">
Mahigit isang taon na kitang mahal,
at wala akong plano para tumigil.
Dahil walang makakapigil,
sa puso kong gusto kang maging akin.

Oo, sa malayo lang kita minamahal,
pero gusto kitang alagaan.
Gusto ko madarama mo ang
pagibig na lubos at walang hangganan.

Ngunit ang gusto ko lang ay mahalin ka
at yun ay sapat na lamang
para sa puso kong lihim kang mahalin.
Dahil ikaw ang ligaya ng pusong akin.
